# Stock-Market-Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict the "Day Price" variable of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) using historical data from four months. We compare three classification models: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Random Forest. These models help investors and traders anticipate the direction of stock prices based on historical patterns and trends.
Objectives

1. Predict the "Day Price" of NSE using historical data.
2. Compare the performance of Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest models.
3. Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Provide a reliable tool for data-driven investment decisions.

Models Compared
1.	Naive Bayes
2.	K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
3.	Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
2. Precision: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
3. Recall: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
4. F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
